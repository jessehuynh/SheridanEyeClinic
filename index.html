						<span>Purchasing Contact Lenses</span> 
						<p>Doctors of Optometry ensure your contact lenses properly correct your vision and attend to your eye health needs.</p>
						<p>Our dispensaries offer a wide variety of contact lens styles and brands. However, not all contact lenses are created equal. It is important to remember that every contact lens product is unique and designed for a particular purpose. This includes everything from material, curvature, fit, oxygen permeability, deposit resistance, moisture content and lifespan. It is never recommended to switch the brand of lenses you are using without consulting a licensed eye care professional. Buying your contact lenses from a Doctor of Optometry will ensure you achieve optimal vision, comfort and eye health.</p>
						<span>By working with your Doctor of Optometry, you will have certainty of:</span>
						<ul>
							<li>The proper contact lens prescription, curvature, and modality based on lifestyle needs, and measurements of your eye curvature, tear chemistry and prescription.</li>
							<li>The appropriate selection of a care system and solutions based on compatibility with different lens materials and compatibility with your eyes.</li>
							<li>Professional monitoring to ensure optimum eye health, good vision and comfortable wear.</li>
							<li>Updates with new lens technology that may better suit your particular vision needs or lifestyle demands.</li>
						</ul> 
							<p>See your Doctor of Optometry annually to monitor the health of your eyes and receive a personal consultation on your contact lens needs. This includes seeking immediate care if you experience any discomfort or vision change, and reporting any problems that may arise.</p>
							<p>Buying Contact Lenses Online Purchasing contact lenses online comes with risks to your vision and eye health. Contact lenses are medical devices that sit directly on your corneas, and lenses that donâ€™t fit correctly, or are not properly used and care for, can cause serious damage to your eyes. Some online sites do not verify the prescription. Without proper verification, you risk wearing an optically incorrect or improperly fitting lens. Many online sites - including those based in Canada - sell products that have not been approved by Health Canada, and the safety of these lenses has not been tested. Your Doctor of Optometry will only fit lenses approved by Health Canada to ensure that your lenses are authentic, accurate, and safe to wear.</p>

					<div class="lens-half two">
						<div class="lenses-steps">
							<span>Contact Lens Fitting</span>
							<li>
								Step 1: Eye Exam &amp; Prescription
								<p>Your Doctor of Optometry will evaluate your overall eye health to ensure your eyes are suitable for wearing contacts. If vision correction is required, a prescription is issued that describes the glasses power needed. They will convert this value into your contact lens power.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								Step 2: Measurements
								<p>A keratometer is used to determine the curvature of your eye, which will determine the curvature and size of your contact lenses.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								Step 3: Corneal Evaluation
								<p>Your Doctor of Optometry will evaluate the health of your cornea and the dryness of your eyes to determine the best contact lens composition and solution. This requires a test to evaluate the tear film of your eyes. Allergies and lifestyle choices will also be considered.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								Step 4: Trial Contact Lenses
								<p>Your Doctor of Optometry will prescribe a trial pair of lenses to be used for period of time. The chosen contact lenses will be the best ones to meet your individual needs.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								Step 5: Final Eye Health Check Up
								<p>At a follow-up appointment, your Doctor of Optometry will determine if your contacts are providing optimal comfort and clarity, while maintaining healthy eyes. If they are, a final contact lens prescription will be provided.</p>
